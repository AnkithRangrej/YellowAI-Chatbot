# YellowAI Chatbot

## Overview
YellowAI Chatbot is a conversational AI platform designed for managing multiple projects and interacting with intelligent chatbots powered by OpenAI's GPT models. This project demonstrates an end-to-end full-stack application integrating Django REST Framework backend with React frontend.

## Features
- User authentication and registration with JWT
- Project creation and management
- AI-assisted chat interface with OpenAI API
- Responsive React UI
- Secure environment and API key management
- Designed for extensibility and scalability

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Django 4.1.7, Django REST Framework 3.14.0, Python 3.10+
- Authentication: djangorestframework-simplejwt 5.2.2
- AI: OpenAI Python SDK 0.27.4
- Frontend: React 18.16.0, JavaScript, CSS
- Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL recommended for production
- Development Tools: pip, virtualenv, npm/yarn

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Git
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/AnkithRangrej/YellowAI-Chatbot.git
cd YellowAI-Chatbot/chatbot

```

#### Backend Setup:
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```

python -m venv venv

# On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux

source venv/bin/activate

```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Configure environment variables:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in your:
  - `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
  - `DEBUG`: True or False

4. Run database migrations:
```

python manage.py migrate

```

5. Start the development server:
```

python manage.py runserver

```

#### Frontend Setup:
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
```

cd ../frontend

```

2. Install dependencies:
```

npm install

```

3. Start the React development server:
```

npm start

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Environment Variables
The backend requires a `.env` file containing:
```

SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
DEBUG=True

```

Never commit `.env` to a public repository.
